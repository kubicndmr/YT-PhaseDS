# YT-PhaseDS: A Base Video Dataset for Pretraining Surgical Phase Recognition Models 

This repo is created to download YouTube videos with chapter functionality from selected queries and licence conditions. The chapters in YouTube videos are similar to phases in a surgery and manually created by uploaders, therefore, can be used for pre-training proposed models. 

## Getting Started

1. To install dependencies, we recommend creating a virtual environment:
```
    - python3 -m venv yt-phaseds-env
    - source yt-phaseds-env/bin/activate
    - pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Follow the Step 1 in following link to create necessary creditentials and replace existing client secret file: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/quickstart/python
